Welcome to the second iteration of my home on the Internet! I decided to give my personal site a bit of a facelift, both to practice some new skills that I’ve been working on (NextJS! TypeScript!) and to make sure that the site reflects where I’m currently at in my career and where I would like to go next.

## Migrating from GatsbyJS to NextJS

NextJS is becoming increasingly dominant in the frontend world, and I wanted to stop my React skills from getting too rusty, as I’m currently in a backend-focussed role. The earlier version of my site was written using GatsbyJS, which I still like as a framework, but I really appreciate NextJS for its native support for TypeScript, simplified data fetching, and smooth developer experience.

## Adding a blog

While refreshing the site’s design, I added a blog section for a couple of reasons:

- I miss writing! Until I made my career change and became a software engineer, all my previous jobs involved a ton of written communication, and I really miss that. While being a clear communicator is a super important part of my current job (especially because I work 100% remotely), I don’t get to do as much long-form writing as I used to.

- I want a place to record and share what I’m learning, even if the only people reading it are myself and my mum (hi Mum!). I really resonate with the concept of [learning in public]()—I think there is real value in writing things down to absorb them better, and to track personal growth.

- Finally, I want to hold myself accountable and maintain forward momentum. Things change quickly in tech, and there is always something new to learn. Having this space to record my journey will help me to feel motivated.

So, watch this space! Expect to see things I’m learning, things I’m curious about, and (tech-related) things that I’m reading or watching or listening to.

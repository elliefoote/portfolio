A few years ago, I did something tough and scary, and which I'm very proud of: I totally changed my career direction, studied full-stack development, and became a software engineer.

Now, after living and working in Barcelona for the past six years, I'm making another huge transition, and moving back to Australia to be closer to my family. I never worked as an engineer while I lived here, so I'm looking forward to exploring Australia's tech and startup scene more (although job hunting is never particularly fun!).

I'm also using this time to revamp this site, start writing more, and experiment with some fun new tech that I never had time to take a look at while working full-time. Watch this space ðŸ˜Š

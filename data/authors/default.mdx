I love a challenge. That’s why I moved halfway across the world from my small hometown in Australia to Barcelona, and it's why I
fell in love with coding.

One of my favourite things about coding is experimenting with new tools and approaches to solve tricky problems faced by customers (or myself!). I'm planning to use this site to document some of my side projects and learnings in this area - coming soon!

In my spare time, I love travelling (30+ countries so far!) and trying new recipes—my next non-tech project is learning to bake bread.

If you'd like to know more or have any bread-baking tips, [get in touch](mailto:eleanorjfoote@gmail.com)!

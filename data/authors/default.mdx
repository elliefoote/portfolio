I love a challenge. That’s why a few years ago I decided to take the big, scary step of changing my career, studying coding at a bootcamp, and becoming a software engeineer. Since then I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing people on super interesting projects - I'm so glad I took the leap!

One of my favourite things about coding is experimenting with new tools and approaches to solve tricky problems faced by customers (or myself!). I use this site to document my side projects and learnings.

In my spare time, I love travelling (40+ countries so far!) and trying new recipes—my next non-tech project is learning to bake bread.

If you'd like to know more or have any bread-baking tips, [get in touch](mailto:eleanorjfoote@gmail.com)!
